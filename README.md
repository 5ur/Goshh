<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
I was looking for a secret/OPT sharing service in [libhunt](https://selfhosted.libhunt.com/), [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#communication---custom-communication-systems), and [awesome-privacy](https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy#pastebin-and-secret-sharing).  
I saw a few projects that were interesting like; [ots](https://github.com/Luzifer/ots) and [privatebin](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin), but I dont like javascropt or php.  
The others I saw were way too complex for me to build and understand, so I opted to make something for myself.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
 - [x] Set the random :id generation to a rune/charset because pluses break it as well
 - [x] Clean up the "\"\n" shit at the end of the message contents.
 - [x] Add the QR code as a flag or config file option.
 - [x] Add file upload
 - [] Add pushover/gotify/azure notification/other push notification support in the Goshh binary or the server depending on if something is passed in the json body?
 - [x] Add a manifest and branding to the scripts.
 - [] Use github actions to compile the binaries
 - [] Add an openapi documentation html page as the root of the server

* [Guy who made this README.md emplate](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) - Gave me the template which you are reading right now
* [MS Paint](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/paint/9PCFS5B6T72H) - Used it to draw the logos
* [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/x/) - Used it to make the logos transparent
* [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) - Retarded, slow, confusing and wrong, but gave me some **really** good tips when when I just started asking it for questions about logic rather than making it write code.
